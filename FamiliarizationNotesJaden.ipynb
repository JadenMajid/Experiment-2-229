    "The initial modeling of the syringe system neglected the friction of the plunger on the sides of the walls of the syringe. \n",
    "In order to factor this in, a friction term will be added to the equation: $PA+mg=P_aA+F_k$ and $PA+mg+F_k=P_aA$, with the first equation corresponding to the gas expanding, and the second equation corresponding to the gas contracting. \n",
    "Kinetic friction was chosen because the gas in the syringe expands or contracts, and the friction acts in the opposite direction, slowing it down as it moves to its equilibrium position. \n",
    "\n",
    "This kinetic friction can be measured by taking two trials of the gas expanding and contracting to equilibrium, and measuring the difference in expansion, providing a constant term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement was completed by starting with an intial volume of 3mL, and adding a $0.5kg$ weight to the syringe. When allowing the syringe to expand to equilibrium, the syringe expanded to 4mL, when allowing the syringe to contract to equilibrium, the syringe contracted to 5mL. This suggests the friction force is \n",
